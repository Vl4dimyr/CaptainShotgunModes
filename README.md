# CaptainShotgunModes

## Description

This mod allows you to choose between 3 firing modes for the captain's shotgun: Normal, Auto and AutoCharge. With both auto modes you can just hold down the fire key and don´t have to spam it.

The modes can be selected using the number keys `1`, `2` and `3`. The current mode is displayed above the primary skill icon.
