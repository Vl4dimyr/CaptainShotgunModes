# CaptainShotgunModes

## Description

This mod allows you to choose between 3 firing modes for the captain's shotgun: `Normal`, `Auto` and `AutoCharge`.
With both auto modes you can just hold down the fire key and donÂ´t have to spam it.

The modes can be selected using the number keys `1`, `2` and `3`, or cycled through using the `mouse wheel` or [DPad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D-pad).
The current mode is displayed above the primary skill icon.

## Modes

> I did add controller support because enough players wanted it! [see](https://github.com/Vl4dimyr/CaptainShotgunModes/issues/1).

> Currently this is only tested with a xbox 360 controller (xbox one should work too).
